std::vector<bool> is a special case in the standard library that's often the source of subtle bugs.  It doesn't behave exactly like other containers due to optimizations for memory usage.  Specifically, it doesn't provide the same level of contiguous memory access. This can lead to unexpected performance penalties, especially when interacting with algorithms or libraries that expect contiguous data.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::vector<bool> boolVector(1000000, false);
  // ... some operations on boolVector that might be slower than expected
  std::cout << "Size: " << boolVector.size() << std::endl;
  std::sort(boolVector.begin(), boolVector.end()); // this could be slow!
  return 0;
}
```
